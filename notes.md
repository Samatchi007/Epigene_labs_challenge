# add pagination to page
# add docstrings to functions
# add tests of crud operations and regex addition
# add post endpoint to add new genes
# add delete for authorized users (and implicitly add authorization scheme)
# we could rewrite some schemas to only return geneset titles and not the whole objects (but it's more of a context specific modification, if we need also the genes it would be counter productive and could lead to a N+1 problem afterwards)
